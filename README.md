# Expressy - A quick & dirty dive into using API's for web dev
Making a simple Express API and using vanilla Javascript to display the data in a browser.

## Get started with the example
* Run "yarn" or "npm install" to install dependencies.
* Split your terminal in two
  * Use command "yarn/npm run frontend" in one.
  * Use command "yarn/npm run backend" in the other.
* Hope that nothing crashes

Best of luck
 
## Quick content guide
### Folders
* The src folder contains
  * The public folder that is what makes up the frontend website which is served using lite-server.
  * The api folder, which is where the code that creates and controls the Express API can be found.
* The node_modules folder is as per usual where dependencies for Node.js are stored.

### Files
* package.json is the file that specifies info about the application, with dependencies listed etc
* README.md is this file but you probably guessed that by now
* yarn.lock | package-lock.json is a file Yarn/NPM uses to keep dependencies in order, generally speaking don't touch it.
* LICENSE is just info about the license of the repository
